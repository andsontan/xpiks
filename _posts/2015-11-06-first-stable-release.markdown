I've started working on Xpiks in November 2014 (a year from now). First alpha release was ready in the end of December 2014, after two months of active development. Since there Xpiks went through 9 beta releases involving more and more users and testers, starting from me and my girlfriend and now it's used by people on Shutterstock forums and by russian microstockers from well-known forums zastavkin.net and microstocks.ru. This release would not be possible without their feedback, bugreports and ideas. Also this project has a maintainer of Debian package and more linux distros support is on the way.

As usual, small changelog:

**Major features** of this release are:

- Keywords Suggestion from the local library
- New dialogs for single item editing
- Advanced filtering support
- Improved scrolling support
- Improved warnings checking

**Fixed issues**:

- Xpiks fails to remove directory added via recent directories #147
- Empty EditableTags steals focus #128
- Xpiks can't read metadata written by some other software #159
- Upload percentage in Windows is not correct #140
