Please meet the beta 0.8! The two main new features it introduces are keywords suggestion with Shutterstock API and automatic zipping previews with vectors before upload. Also I added several useful features like showing percentage for each stock while uploading artworks and several other UX improvements. Also I fixed the issue with 123rf test connection and master password hard reset.

List of all changes:

- keywords suggestion based on Shutterstock API
- ability to zip items before upload with as simple as checking a checkbox
- we now have build for Debian-based systems
- ability to dismiss popups by clicking on an empty space
- settings window is completely redesigned
- upload now doesn't start every stock in parallel but uses a queue
- drag'n'drop for directories
- upload percentage is shown for each stock separately

And fixes:

- fixed 123rf test connection always failed issue #74
- fixed issue with About dialog #86
- fixed issue with master password hard reset
- fixed issue with dreamtimes upload
